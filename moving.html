  <body>
    schooltimer.glitch.me has moved. <br> <br>
    Just go to the new link located here:  <a class="linky" href="https://www.lukegutman.com/timer/" >New School Timer</a> <br>
    If the new link doesn't work, come back here. My server must have caught on fire.<br><br>

    <h1>Where is it going?</h1>
    <p class="indent">-My website hosted on my own server.</p> <br> <image src="https://cdn.glitch.com/390502de-2af3-469c-b617-f038bf730a5f%2F20190928_163022%20(2).jpg?v=1569758753818" width="200"></image><br>
    <h1>Why does that server look like it was designed and built in 5 minutes?</h1>
    <p class="indent">-Because it was.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>
    Why is it moving?
    </h1>
     <p class="indent">
         1. I have no control over glitch.com
    <br> 2. glitch.com is slow.
    <br> 3. Lot easier to add libraries if i want to add complex features.
    <br> 4. schooltimer.glitch.me is a confusing URL for some people and it's hard to remember.
    <br> 5. It's really fun to say, "I have a server."
